Using our GUI is actually quite simple. In all reallity all 
that must be done is to first take the code from GitHub and 
paste it into a new tab on matlab. Then save the file as 
projectileMotion. Then simply type projectileMotion into the 
command window. 

Once this is done there will be a figure that pops up on
the screen. The display will have a big white blank graph 
in the center of the screen. Under it will be two sliders, 
one for Initial Velocity and one for Launch Angle. Next 
to these two sliders are two zeros. And next to those is a 
big calculate button. In order to use the figure slide the 
Initial Velocity slider to the desired value, with a 
maximum of 500 m/s, and slide the Launch Angle Slider to the
desired value with a maximum of 90 degrees. Then select 
calculate and a graph will appear before you. If you want 
to see any values on the graph, simply drag your cursor to 
the point that you want to select and left click on it. This 
will then display the vertical and horizontal distance of the 
object.
